# BB_Biodiversity Overview

The goal of this module and challenge was to build an interactive and customizable dashboard for volunteers to login and see results.  

These results will help researchers identify which bacteria types they should buy for synthetic beef production.  Roza's credibility will definitely jump from this work!

This was a fun challenge and I enjoyed creating various types of plots to achieve cool visualizations for Roza.
